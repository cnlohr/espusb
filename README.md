# ESP8266 USB Software Driver

I wanted to have USB on the ESP8266, and a while ago I saw on the ESP32 flier, it read: "Rich Peripherals" ... "Sorry, no USB!" I thought to myself, that is ridiculous.  Of course there's USB.

So, it was born.  This is a software USB stack running on the ESP8266/ESP8285.  It requires only one external resistor, between D- and 3.3V.

## Limitations

- You cannot use SDKs newer than 1.5.X. (As of dec-02-2016, 1.5.4 is the latest SDK that has been verified to be compatible.)
- All ESP SDK 2.0 SDKs are incompatible.
- By default, the chip expects D- on GPIO 4 and D+ on GPIO 5 - but any GPIO pair may be used.  It is important to note that both D- and D+ MUST be adjacent.
- This project only operates with low-speed USB (1.5 MBit/s)
  ideal for making peripherals, not for fake network devices and usb-serial bridges.  
  That said - you can still write "control" messages that communicate with the ESP8266.  
  Control messages are a great way to encapsulate your data since they handle all the framing and describing what function you wish to pass data for.

## Examples

This project contains an example that simulates a usb keyboard and mouse. It also provides a web interface to actually remote control these virtual devices.

## How to use
For a complete guide that includes information on how to install the toolchain or set up a docker container, go here: [Getting started guide](https://github.com/cnlohr/espusb/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide)
If you already have an environment with the toolchain, then here is what you wanna do:

### Software

- Install libusb and recursively clone this repo: 
  
  ``` bash
  sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/cnlohr/espusb
  cd espusb
  ```

- `user.cfg` contains some settings that you might have to change to get it working. 

- Building/flashing the main binary
  
  ``` bash
  make ESP_ROOT=~/esp8266/esp-open-sdk/ burn
  ```

- Building/flashing the web interface (for the example mentioned above)
  
  ``` bash
  make ESP_ROOT=~/esp8266/esp-open-sdk/ burnweb
  ```

For more advanced building/flashing methods just run `make` without any parameters.

## Advanced information

### Hardware

![Schematic](schematic.png)

NOTE: GPIO12/14 do not need to be connected to ground. GPIO15 may be connected via a pull-down resistor.  For stability, a pull-up on GPIO2 is recommended.

Also, checkout the hardware/ folder.  It has kicad designs for my tiny board.  Though they are for the ESP8285, the same pin configuration may be used to run on the ESP8266.

### Memory Usage

This is typical memory usage for a two-endpoint (in addition to EP0) device.

In summary:

Total SRAM: 232 bytes + Descriptors (~317 bytes)

Total Flash/IRAM (Only iram, tables and usb_init can be stuck in slow flash): 1422 bytes

More details:

SRAM:

```
0000007c D usb_ramtable
0000006c B usb_internal_state
```
IRAM:

You must write: usb_handle_custom_control - the demos here hook it up to the command engine which allows self flashing on 1MB+ parts.

C functions:
```
0000002a T usb_pid_handle_ack
0000014f T usb_pid_handle_data
00000022 T usb_pid_handle_out
000000e9 T usb_pid_handle_in
00000002 T usb_pid_handle_sof
00000039 T usb_pid_handle_setup
```
From/To (in ASM):
```
40100f20 t usb_asm_start
401011ef t usb_asm_end
Total length of ASM: 2cf
```
